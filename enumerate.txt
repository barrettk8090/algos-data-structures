enumerate(nums) takes the list nums and gives you a special kind of iterator. This iterator doesn't just give you the numbers, it gives you pairs of numbers and their positions. 

So, for the list [2, 7, 11, 15], it would give you pairs like (0, 2), (1, 7), (2, 11), and (3, 15). 

The first number in each pair is the position of the item in the list, and the second number is the item itself.
